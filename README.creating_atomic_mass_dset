SUPPLYING ATOMIC MASSES TO THE TOOLS

The mass of the atoms participating in the processed topology, should
be stored in the memory allocated by the tool xdrmaps, as an array of
floating point numbers. That array is initially supplied to xdrmaps
as HDF5 data set with name "mass" and data type H5T_IEEE_F32LE. On the
file system the data set is stored in a file, which name (and full
path) is given to xdrmaps as an invoking (starting) parameter.

An example on how to create the array with the atomic masses and how
to store in as HDF5 data set, is given by Python script
create_atomic_mass_dset.py, which is a part of this package source
code (it is located in the folder python/).


AN IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THE INDEXING OF THE ARRAY WITH ATOMIC MASSES

IT IS MANDATORY! When preparing the array with the masses, always use
as a reference GRO or PDB file taken from the trajectory which will be
processed. That can be done by the GROMACS tool trjconv:

gmx trjconv -f traj.trr -s topol.tpr -o trajout.gro -b 0 -e 0

if the starting time of the simulation is 0.000, change it otherwise.

If the GRO file atom coordinate section contains 6 rows:

    1GMO     O2    1   7.445   8.120   4.792  0.3384  0.5108  0.1254
    1GMO     H2    1   7.394   8.052   4.835 -1.7992  1.5276 -0.6570
    1GMO    C20    1   7.389   8.231   4.850 -0.6080  0.0839  0.0727
    1GMO     H6    1   7.436   8.326   4.817  2.7133 -0.6428  2.2186
    1GMO     H7    1   7.415   8.222   4.958  1.4281  1.6845 -0.2137
    1GMO    C19    1   7.231   8.248   4.840 -0.0945 -0.6635 -0.2032

the connection between the atom serial numbers and the indexes in the
atomic mass array is established as:

atom serial number (row number) : 1 2 3 4 5 6
index in the mass array         : 0 1 2 3 4 5

and it corresponds to the atomic mass array:

mass[0]=15.9994
mass[1]=1.00794
mass[2]=12.0107
mass[3]=1.00794
mass[4]=1.00794
mass[5]=12.0107

where the atomic mass is supplied in g/mol!

The actual atom serial number is the corresponding row number of the
atom in the coordinate section in the PDB or GRO file! The first row
in that section is assigned row number 1. Do not use the atom serial
number stored in the column designated for storing atom serial
numbers (both GRO and PBD standards define such a column). That
column in no more read by the modern MD and MC tools. The reason is
its limited width that prevents it from accommodating integer
numbers greater then 99999. Nowadays a large amount of simulations
operate on large systems containing more than 99999 atoms.
